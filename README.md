**Carrie Qian Stop-Motion Content Maker - Portfolio**

**About**

This is a website showcases Carrie Qian's stop motion projects. It is created for my MS1 project with Code Institute. It is a basic portfolio.

I hope that while letting the user see my projects, it can also stimulate everyone's creative needs and desires, so that everyone takes a moment to observe days and things surrounding us,  to use the common things we see in everyday life,  to create a new magic world for ourselves. To get rid of the concept that creation is only for professionals, enjoy the fun of creating content. 

The skills of making these videos are something easy to grasp. But to grasp the creative thinking through making the videos, through lots of practice on them, are the most important thing. This is another message I want to share with users. 

Mainly for the people looking for someone to work within this field, I hope this website can work as a proper portfolio to show my capabilities.
